# Economic-Analysis-S-P-500-and-State-Unemployment-Trends-Visualization

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing economic data, particularly related to the S&P 500 index and unemployment rates across different U.S. states. The data is sourced fromthe Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API. The analysis is performed using Python,leveraging data processing and visualization libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and plotly.

## Features 
  - Data Retrieval: Fetches economic data (S&p 500 and unemployment rates) using the FRED 
    API.
  - Data Cleaning: Processes the data to remove missing values and redundant columns.
  - Data Visualization: Line Charts, Bar charts and Interactive visualizations using plotly.

## Prerequisites 

The following Python libraries:

  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - plotly
  - fredapi

### API Key
This project uses the FRED API to fetch economic data. To run the script, you will need a FRED API key. If you don't have one, you can request it from the FRED API website.

## Data Visualization
The script generates various plots that allow you to analyze: 

  - S&P 500 Index: A line chart showing the S&P 500 trends over time.
  - State-wise Unemployment Rates: A bar chart comparing unemployment rates across U.S. 
    states.
  - Intercative Charts: You can generate interactive visualizations using plotly,
    offering hover features and zooming capabilities.

## Economic Insights 
To provide economic insights based on the Python script's analysis, let's break down what the data is revealing in the context of the S&P 500 and state-wise unemployment rates: 

### S&P 500 Index Trends 

  - Analysis: The script pulls the historical data of the S&P 500 and plots its trend 
    over time. The S&P 500 is composed of different sectors. Comparing overall index
    performance to individual sectors can reveal how specific parts of the economy are 
    performing.
  - Insights:

     · The S&P 500 is a crucial indicator of the overall health of stocks market and
       reflects the perdormance of 500 of the largest companies of the U.S.
     · Long-term trends: Upward trends typically indicate investor confidence, economic 
       growth, and strong corporate performance. This could be driven by strong 
       corporate earnings, low interest rates, or economic stimuli(tax cuts, monetary 
       policy). 
     · Short-term volatility: Downward trends could signal economic downturns, market 
       corrections, or external shocks. Providing a high volatility periods comparision
       with major conomic or political events to see how sensitive the market is to 
       external factors.
